        Rick and Morty is an American animated science fiction sitcom created by Justin Roiland and
        Dan Harmon. The show premiered on Adult Swim, a late-night programming block on Cartoon
        Network, in 2013 and has gained a huge following since then. The show follows the adventures
        of an eccentric, alcoholic scientist named Rick Sanchez and his good-hearted but easily
        influenced grandson, Morty Smith, as they travel through different dimensions and parallel
        universes using Ricks portal gun.

      <p className="about__title">
        The show is known for its dark humor, clever writing, and complex plotlines that often
        involve scientific concepts, existentialism, and nihilism. It combines elements of comedy,
        adventure, and science fiction, creating a unique blend of humor and mind-bending
        storytelling. Rick is portrayed as a brilliant yet deeply flawed character who often
        prioritizes his own self-interests and indulges in reckless behavior, while Morty serves as
        the moral compass of the duo, grappling with the ethical implications of their
        interdimensional escapades.
